  <p>Easily provide repository data to a Google Search Appliance (GSA).

  <p> If you'd like to use a language other than Java see if
  {@link adaptorlib.prebuilt.CommandLineAdaptor} fits your needs.
  </p>

  <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Add the IP address of the computer that hosts the adaptor to the <b>List
      of Trusted IP Addresses</b> on the GSA.
      <p>In the GSA's Admin Console, go to <b>Crawl and Index &gt; Feeds</b>,
      and scroll down to <b>List of Trusted IP Addresses</b>. Add the IP address
      for the adaptor to the list.</p>
    <li>Add the URLs provided by the adaptor to the <b>Follow and Crawl Only
      URLs with the Following Patterns</b> on the GSA.
      <p>In the Admin console, go to <b>Crawl And Index &gt; Crawl URLs</b>, and
      scroll down to <b>Follow and Crawl Only URLs with the Following
      Patterns</b>. Add an entry like {@code hostname:port/} where {@code
      hostname} is the hostname of the machine that hosts the adaptor and {@code
      port} defaults to 5678 (read on to change port #).</p>
  </ol>

  <h3>Running the Adaptor Template, as an initial test</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Compile the source code. You need ant and JDK 6 or higher. 
      <p><pre> ant build </pre>
    <li>Start the Adaptor Template:
      <p><pre> ant run -Dadaptor.args=-Dgsa.hostname=mygsahostname</pre>
      <p>Alternatively create an adaptor-config.properties file that looks like:
      <pre>
        gsa.hostname=mygsahostname
      </pre>
      <p>And then run:
      <pre> ant run</pre>
      <p>You can add more configuraiton into the adaptor-config.properties file:
      <pre>
        gsa.hostname=mygsahostname
        server.port=6677
        feed.name=mydocfeedtogsa
      </pre>
    <li> Confirm things ran successfully.
      <p>
      In the GSA go to <b>Crawl and Index &gt; Feeds</b>.
      In the <b>Current Feeds</b> section, you should see an entry for a
      "testfeed".
      <p>
      In the adaptor log look to see document ids being pushed and
      requests for document contents being served.
  </ol>

  <h3>Creating your own Adaptor</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Either modify adaptortemplate/AdaptorTemplate.java or copy it first 
      and create a new ant build target in build.xml .
    <li>Compile, run, and verify the results like you did before, except use
      your new class.
    <li>Declare success for getting content from your custom repository to the
      GSA.
  </ol>
