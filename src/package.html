Good day,
<p>
If you don't want to get your repository contents into
the GSA you can stop reading now.
<p>
This package contains source code for a "feed program"
that moves repository contents to the GSA.  This code is
written in Java and is intended for repositories that
can be contacted using Java.  
<p>
If you use C# or C code then considering using:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;TODO_link_to_C#_version
<p>
If you can provide binaries to list repository instead:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;TODO_link_to_binary_running_template_version
<p>
<hr>

Important stages of job to get contents onto GSA:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Configure hostnames and ports.
<li> Tell GSA to trust your connector.
<li> Compile the source code.
<li> Run a test of configuration parameters.
<li> View Feed info on GSA.
<li> Implement connector methods in RepositoryConnector.java
<li> Compile, test, inspect the GSA.
<li> Declare success for getting content from custom repository to GSA.
</ol>

<li> Configure hostnames and ports.<br>
<p>
 Put GSA IP address (or hostname) into SystemPreferences.java
 Provide port number for feed program.

<li> Tell GSA to trust your connector.<br>
<p>
 The IP address of the computer that hosts this feed
 program must be in the List of Trusted IP Addresses.
 In the Admin Console, go to Crawl and Index > Feeds,
 and scroll down to List of Trusted IP Addresses.
 Verify that the IP address for this feed program 
 appears in this list. 
<p>
 The URLs provided by this feed program must match
 an entry in Follow and Crawl Only URLs with the
 Following Patterns.  The URLs from this feed program
 look like http://host:port/path-to-document.
 In the Admin console, go to Crawl And Index > Crawl
 URLs, and scroll down to Follow and Crawl Only URLs
 with the Following Patterns.  Verify that the patterns
 match the URLs coming from this feed program.
<hr>

<li> Compile the source code (more below).
<p>

This source code can be compiled using Java version 6
and higher with the following command:<br>
<p>
`javac *java'
<hr>

<li> Run a test of configuration parameters.
<p>
java RepositoryConnector
<hr>

<li> View Feed info on GSA.
<p>
<hr>

<li> Implement connector methods in RepositoryConnector.java
<p>
<hr>

<li> Compile, test, inspect the GSA.
<p>
<hr>

<li> Declare success for getting content from custom repository to GSA.
