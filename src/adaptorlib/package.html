  <p>Easily provide repository data to a Google Search Appliance (GSA). This is
  accomplished by a combination of a document feed, pushed to the GSA, that
  provides a list of files to load and an accompanying HTTP server that provides
  the file contents upon request. This code is written in Java and is intended
  for repositories that can be contacted using Java.</p>

  <p>If your repository can be accessed purely by a non-interactive command line
  application, see if the {@link consoleadaptor.CommandLineAdaptor} fits your
  needs. Otherwise, you will need to create your own {@link adaptorlib.Adaptor}.
  </p>

  <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
  <p>Before any adaptor can work, you must:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Modify the Config class at {@code src/adaptorlib/Config.java}. You need
      to change {@link adaptorlib.Config#getGsaHostname} to the hostname of your
      GSA. If you want, you can also modify the port to use for the built-in
      HTTP server in {@link adaptorlib.Config#getLocalPort}.</li>
    <li>Add the IP address of the computer that hosts the adaptor to the <b>List
      of Trusted IP Addresses</b> on the GSA.
      <p>In the GSA's Admin Console, go to <b>Crawl and Index &gt; Feeds</b>,
      and scroll down to <b>List of Trusted IP Addresses</b>. Add the IP address
      for the adaptor to the list.</p></li>
    <li>Add the URLs provided by the adaptor to the <b>Follow and Crawl Only
      URLs with the Following Patterns</b> on the GSA.
      <p>In the Admin console, go to <b>Crawl And Index &gt; Crawl URLs</b>, and
      scroll down to <b>Follow and Crawl Only URLs with the Following
      Patterns</b>. Add an entry like {@code hostname:port/} where {@code
      hostname} is the hostname of the machine that hosts the adaptor and {@code
      port} matches the one in {@link adaptorlib.Config#getLocalPort}.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Running the Adaptor Template, as an initial test</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Compile the source code. You need JDK 6 or higher. For Windows:
      <pre>{@code build-command.bat}</pre>
      <p>For Unix:</p>
      <pre>{@code ./build-command.sh}</pre></li>
    <li>Start the Adaptor Template:
      <pre>{@code java -cp classes templateadaptor.TemplateAdaptor}</pre></li>
    <li>(TODO: modify the Adaptor Template to push immediately to help with this
      step?) After the adaptor has pushed an initial feed (TODO: how do they
      know this happened), in the GSA go to <b>Crawl and Index &gt; Feeds</b>.
      In the <b>Current Feeds</b> section, you should see an entry for a
      "testfeed".</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Creating your own Adaptor</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Copy TemplateAdaptor and begin modifying it for your own use. TODO:
      describe how to provide feed name in Config</li>
    <li>Compile, run, and verify the results like you did before, except use
      your new class.</li>
    <li>Declare success for getting content from your custom repository to the
      GSA.</li>
  </ol>
