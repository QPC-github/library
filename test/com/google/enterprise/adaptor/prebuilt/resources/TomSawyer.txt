snippet from Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain.

"Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had
discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it -- namely, that in
order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the
thing difficult to attain."
